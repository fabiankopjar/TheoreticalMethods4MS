    "# Exercise: Diffusion of Hydrogen in Palladium\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool for understanding the atomic-scale mechanisms that underlie real-world materials behavior. In fields like hydrogen storage, fuel cells, and catalysis, the ability of hydrogen to diffuse through metals such as palladium is of critical importance. However, these processes are difficult to observe directly at the atomic level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will study the diffusion of hydrogen (H) atoms in a palladium (Pd) matrix using molecular dynamics simulations. Palladium has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, and hydrogen atoms occupy interstitial sites, forming an interstitial solid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with equilibrated atomic configurations of Pd with a dilute concentration of hydrogen (`PdH_equilibrated_*.data`) at different temperatures (350 K, 400 K, 450 K, 500 K). Your task is to analyze how hydrogen atoms move through the Pd lattice over time, and to extract physical insights about the diffusion process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load time-resolved mean squared displacement (MSD) data for H atoms,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit a linear model to the MSD vs. time curves to determine diffusion coefficients at each temperature,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct an Arrhenius plot of $\\ln D$ vs. $1/T$ to extract the activation energy for hydrogen diffusion in palladium."
